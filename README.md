## DNA Editing & GMO Analysis with Deep Learning

`biomass_regression.ipynb`  model predicts whether a genetic modification in DNA has a beneficial, neutral, or harmful effect using a deep learning approach. The dataset consists of labeled DNA sequences, which are transformed into numerical features for training a neural network.

##DNA-to-Protein Translation with Transformers

codon_translation.ipynb model translates DNA sequences into protein sequences using a Transformer model, mimicking how biological systems synthesize proteins.
