# Smart agriculture with biochemical insights Tutorial

## DNA Editing & GMO Analysis with Deep Learning

`DNA_Gmo.ipynb`  model predicts whether a genetic modification in DNA has a beneficial, neutral, or harmful effect using a deep learning approach. The dataset consists of labeled DNA sequences, which are transformed into numerical features for training a neural network.

##DNA-to-Protein Translation with Transformers

`codon_translation.ipynb` model translates DNA sequences into protein sequences using a Transformer model, mimicking how biological systems synthesize proteins.

##K-Means Clustering in Biochemical Agriculture

`genetic_similarities.ipynb` clustering approach groups DNA sequences based on their similarity, helping to detect genetic variations or classify plants with similar biochemical traits.

## Multiple Regression to Study Biochemical Effects on Plant Growth

`biomass_regression.ipynb` predict plant growth (measured as biomass in grams) based on biochemical factors (Soil Nitrogen Content (N, in mg/kg), Soil pH, Chlorophyll Content (Chl, in SPAD units), Enzyme Activity (EA, in μmol/g/min) using linear regression

## Classifying Plant Diseases Using Biochemical Markers
`disease_type_knn.ipynb` classifies  whether a plant is healthy, infected with a fungal disease, or infected with a bacterial disease based on biochemical markers (Leaf Chlorophyll Content (SPAD units), Soil pH, Nitrogen Content (mg/kg), Enzyme Activity (μmol/g/min), Leaf Moisture (%).
